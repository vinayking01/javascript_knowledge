<!-- The Fetch API and AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) are both used to make HTTP requests in JavaScript, but they have some differences in terms of features, syntax, and browser support. Here's a comparison:

(A) fetch() Function: - The fetch() function is an API provided by modern web browsers for making HTTP requests.
It takes the URL of the resource you want to fetch as its first argument and returns a promise that resolves to a Response object representing the response to your request.

Even though you didn't explicitly create a promise using the Promise constructor in the code example, fetch() internally creates and returns a promise for you

(B) One important point is when you use fetchAPI for API call it requires to stage process to get the repsonse data. In first .then() always check whether call was successful or not in second .then() function you get the response data.
