/* 1Ô∏è‚É£. Event Propogation  -  It define in which order the element revies events. it is only seen when parent and child bothe have some events defined. By deafult it is always buuble phase.
There are two phases or order in which it works
   (A) Bubble Phase- starts with bottom most element to top. eg - flows goes to child to parent
   (B) Capture Phase - Starts with Topmost element to bottom. eg- flows goes to parent to child . It can be achieved only with addeventListner method no other event calling ways.

        // Now instead of calling each function indivisually we can call it
        // by simply using one function that is calculator 

            console.log(calculator(5,6,add));
            console.log(calculator(5,6,subs));
            console.log(calculator(5,6,mult));

    // In the above example, calculator is the higher-order function, 
    // which accepts three arguments, the third one being the callback.
    // Here the calculator is called the Higher Order Function because it takes
    // another function as an argument and add, sub and mult are called the callback function bcz they are passed  as an argument to another fucntion

    // 5Ô∏è‚É£ Hoisting in JavaScript 

    /* we have a creation phase and execution phase.
    Hoisting in Javascript is a mechanism where variables and functions . declarations are moved to the top of their scope before the code execute but not work for function expression. var is hoisted but not with setting vlaues (automatic intialized with undefined), let and var does not support .


        For Example üëá
        console.log(myName);
        let myName;
        myName = "thapa";

      How it will be in output during creation phase 

        1: var myName = undefined;
        2: console.log(myName);
        3: myName = "thapa";
    üò≤ In ES2015 (a.k.a. ES6), hoisting is avoided by using the let keyword

        // Lexical Scoping means Now, the inner function can get access to their parent functions variables But the vice-versa is not true.
