    2. A function can be made async by using Asycnc keyword.

    3. async function always retuns a promise. it auomatically wrpas the other values as a promise.

    4. The Await Keyword.
    this keywords always works inside the async function .

    // when you run this code the program doesn't stop in a paticular function if there is async function it will run parllely and also wait if there is some await statement but parllely runs the code along with async function .
