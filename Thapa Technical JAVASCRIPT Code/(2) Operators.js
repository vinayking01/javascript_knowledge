// Data types in js - Two types 

// 1. Primitive Data Types - string , number, boolean, undefined , Null, symbol , Bigint.

// 2. Non Primitive Data Types - Array, Object, map, set , functions 

// Primitive data types are stored in Stack and are immutable, and non - primitive are stored in Heap are mutable they are stored by reference, ( reference look at the PDF)


let name = "John";
name = "Don";  // Youâ€™re not changing "John". You're reassigning the variable name to point to a new string "Don", The original value "John" stays untouched


let person = { name: "Alice" };
person.name = "Bob"; // This changes the value inside the object
console.log(person)
