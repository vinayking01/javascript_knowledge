1. Promises 

In JavaScript promises, the .then() method is used to handle both successful fulfillment and error rejection. The .then() method takes two callback functions as arguments:

The first callback function is executed when the promise is successfully resolved (fulfilled).
The second callback function is executed when the promise is rejected (failed).
Here's an example:

javascript
Copy code
promise.then(
    function (successValue) {
        console.log("Code runs successfully with value: " + successValue);
    },
    function (errorValue) {
        console.log("Code giving error with value: " + errorValue);
    }
);

Yes, in JavaScript promises, the order of callback functions passed to the .then() method determines their purpose, not their names. Specifically:

The first callback function passed to .then() is always for handling the successful fulfillment of the promise. It receives the resolved value as its argument. You can name this parameter anything you want, such as successValue, result, data, etc. The order in which you define this function is what matters for identifying it as the success handler.

The second callback function (optional in some cases) passed to .then() is for handling the rejection of the promise. It receives the rejected value as its argument. Again, you can name this parameter as you like, such as errorValue, reason, err, etc. Its position as the second function passed to .then() signifies that it's the error handler.


2. FETCH API 
JSON Object:
A JSON object is a concept in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). It is a data structure that follows the JSON syntax rules, consisting of key-value pairs where keys are strings and values can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, other JSON objects, or null.

Example of a JSON object:

json
Copy code
{ "name": "John", "age": 30, "isStudent": false }
JSON String:
A JSON string is a textual representation of JSON data. It is a sequence of characters that represents JSON content. JSON strings are enclosed in double quotes (").

Example of a JSON string:

json
Copy code
'{"name": "John", "age": 30, "isStudent": false}'
JavaScript Object:
A JavaScript object is a data structure in JavaScript. It represents a collection of properties, where each property has a key and a value. JavaScript objects are not restricted to JSON syntax rules and can include functions as values.

Example of a JavaScript object:

javascript
Copy code
{ name: 'John', age: 30, isStudent: false }
Now, back to response.json():

When you call response.json() in a fetch request, it parses the JSON content from the response body and returns a Promise. When that Promise resolves (i.e., after calling .then()), it provides you with a JavaScript object that represents the parsed JSON data. This JavaScript object is not a JSON string; it's a usable JavaScript object that you can work with in your code.
